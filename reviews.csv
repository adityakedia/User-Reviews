1,2023-07-29 20:03:56,"By law products have to be marked where they are manufactured, but this information is not readily available in this app. I am a big proponent of buying American made products. The information on the products sold does not always contain country of origin information, and sometimes have to dig through the pictures to find out to the point I waist hours looking. And on at least one occasion I thought a product I was ordering was made in the US and found out when it arrived it was made in China so I returned it.

If we could filter by country of origin, this would be helpful. Especially for high end goods like kitchen equipment, furniture, tools, decorative items and wood products where country of origin is largely indicative of the quality of the product.
